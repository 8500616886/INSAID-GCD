Missing Value Problem
	Methods
		Numerical (Mean/Median)
			Model based - Accurate
			Local Average
			Default Value
			Global Average - Simplistic
			==> Play around SD, Variance, Kurtosis, Skewness
		Categorical
			Model based - Accurate
			Local Mode
			Default Value
			Global Mode - Simplistic
			==> Logistic - KNN
			==> DNN
			
	


Feature Engineering
1. Scaling - Global
2. Creation - Individual
3. Selection - Global - Statistical Correlation or Model based selection - Feature importance
4. Transformation - Individual - Log, Z, Polynomial, Square - Data was not linear; So to do linear regression, we transfrom the data into a new dimension where it becomes linear
5. Pre-Processing - Global - Outlier detection, Removing Wierd Data
6. Dimensionality Reduction - Global - PCA - Matrix transformation to create new columns to explain new concepts, Kernel Methods
